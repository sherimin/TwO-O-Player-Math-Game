# TwO-O-Player Math Game

## Project description

This 2-Player math game is a project for Lighthouse Labs Module 9 where users can take turns to answer simple math addition problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

Use "ruby main.rb" to start the game.
